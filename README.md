Notes about Assignment 4 :
->  the accuracy over test set and training set generally increase with number of epochs due to lowering of loss func.
->  with increasing size of layers and epochs lower test error can be achieved 
->  with decrease in batch size the acuuracy is generally increase for smaller number of iterations .
->  Big batch size sometimes give very high errors probabaly due converging at local minimas of cost function
