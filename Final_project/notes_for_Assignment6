The code starts with importing necessary modules and defining the neccesary parameters.
Loading of cifar100 dataset is done by in-built functions of keras(hastle free solution). the data is dowloaded if not on dataset cache and it
returns 50,000 train and 10,000 test images in form of numpy arrays reshaped as (number of images , dim1 , dim2 , channels)

Data is first normalized by dividing values by 255 since range 0-255

A sequential model architecture of keras is called .
There are 2 sets of feture extraction layers with identical parameters

Two Conv2D layers are added with kernel_size = 3 and filters 512 , 256 and "same" padding is used to preseve spatial dimentions (32x32 pixel img)
